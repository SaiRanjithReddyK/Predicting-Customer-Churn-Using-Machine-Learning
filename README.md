# **Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning**


**Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict customer churn using structured customer data. The project will leverage various data science techniques including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and data visualization. The goal is to build a robust model that can help companies identify customers at high risk of churning, thereby enabling better customer retention strategies.


**Dataset:**
We will use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset provides information about a telecommunication company's customers, including demographic details and services subscribed.

**Components of the Project:**
Data Collection and Cleaning:
Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and remove any inconsistencies.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of data.
Visualize data using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps to identify patterns and relationships.


**Feature Engineering:**
Create new features from existing data (e.g., tenure groups, total services).
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scale numerical features using standardization or normalization.


**Statistical Analysis:**
Perform hypothesis testing to identify significant variables.
Use regression analysis (both linear and logistic) to determine relationships between variables.
Conduct inferential statistics to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.
Analyze correlations between variables to identify strong relationships.
Apply ANOVA or chi-square tests to determine the relationship between categorical variables and the target variable (churn).


**Predictive Modeling:**
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Build and evaluate various models including:
Random Model: Establish a baseline by generating a random model and calculating the worst-case log-loss.
Logistic Regression: Perform logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning.
Decision Trees: Implement decision trees for classification.
Random Forests: Use random forests for improved accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Apply gradient boosting for better performance.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Implement SVM with hyperparameter tuning.
Neural Networks: Explore neural networks for complex patterns.
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.

**Model Comparison and Visualization:**
Compared  the performance of different models using visualizations such as ROC curves and precision-recall curves.
Visualize model performance using confusion matrices and feature importance plots.


**Conclusion:**
This Model implementations should be able to handle the errors encountered during the prediction and provide a complete workflow for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
